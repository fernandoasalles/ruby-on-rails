# Ruby on Rails – Learning Projects

Welcome to my Ruby on Rails journey! 🚀

This repository contains small projects and exercises developed while learning the Rails framework. I'm exploring how Rails handles MVC architecture, routes, models, controllers, views, and scaffolds.

## 🧱 Projects Included

- `scaffold-livros/`: basic CRUD using scaffold generator
- `crud-manual-clientes/`: full CRUD built manually
- More coming soon...

## 🎯 Goals

- Build real-world features using Rails
- Understand the request/response cycle
- Learn how Active Record maps Ruby to databases
- Practice routes, controllers, views, and helpers
- Deploy small apps eventually

## 🛠 Environment

- Ruby: 3.x
- Rails: 7.x
- Database: SQLite (for now)
- OS: Windows / WSL2 / Ubuntu
- Editor: VS Code

## 🤝 License
